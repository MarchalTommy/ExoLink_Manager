# ExoLink Manager

# What is it ?

<aside>
💡 ExoLink Manager is a Kotlin + Compose app designed to help centralise on a FireStore database the deeplinks used in all of our projects. It has been build as a side project on my free time to work on Compose.

It is simple yet powerful, with the ability to add edit or remove deeplinks, add some to favorites, filter them, generate a QR code for the deeplink, or just share it as text !

## Architecture

<aside>
🖥️ I tried to approach it as a MVVM Clean-arch basic app, but I quite didn’t knew what I was doing with compose, so I might have done some mistakes regarding the architecture around the composables components and the mono-activity_zero-fragment_app !
I might update the project if I have time, motivation, and a better understanding around compose architecture !
