# ExoLink Manager

# What is it ?

<aside>
üí° ExoLink Manager is a Kotlin + Compose app designed to help centralise on a FireStore database the deeplinks used in all of our projects. It has been build as a side project on my free time to work on Compose.

It is simple yet powerful, with the ability to add edit or remove deeplinks, add some to favorites, filter them, generate a QR code for the deeplink, or just share it as text ! And it DOESN'T have ads (take that, play store deeplinks apps !)

## Architecture

<aside>
üñ•Ô∏è I tried to approach it as a MVVM Clean-arch basic app, but I quite didn‚Äôt knew what I was doing with compose, so I might have done some mistakes regarding the architecture around the composables components and the mono-activity_zero-fragment_app !
I might update the project if I have time, motivation, and a better understanding around compose architecture !

## FAQ

#### Why did you do that ?
- Because I could, because I wanted to build something to familiarise with compose and the latest libraries availlable
- Because I grew sick to run after all the deeplinks while working on business projects

#### When do you work on it ?
- When I'm not working for my company
- When I'm not playing Divinity or some other great RPG's
- When my girlfriend is sleeping and thinks I am too (just kidding, everybody knows devs don't have girlfriend (just kidding again, love if you read this I'm JOKING, please stay !))
- When I want / think about it
